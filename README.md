# Attention-Based Pointer Network for Grammatical Parsing of Sentences
This is a neural network that can perform constituency parsing of sentences, to generate constituency trees complete with part-of-speech tagging, and morphology classification of tokens.

This leverages a novel \(m\)-affine layer that models conditional probabilities, allowing classification of tokens to be better-informed in a multi-task setting by the results of other tasks.

Trained on the German TIGER dataset.
